# Description

A fitness tracker application that allows users to create workouts, add exercises to those workouts, and see visualizations of the data from those workouts. 

# Walk-through

1. When a user navigates to the website they are either presented with data about their workout, as well as the buttons that allow them to either continue the last workout or start a new one, or, if no data exists the user is presented with a button to create a workout.

2. On the exercise page a user is presented with one of two forms depending on if they are creating a cardio or resistance exercise. 

3. After exercises have been created they can then be viewed from the dashboard page.
